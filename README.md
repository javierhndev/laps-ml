# LAPS-ML (LAser Pulse Shaping using Machine Learning)
This repository consist on notebooks and python modules used to model laser pulse shapes from the Galadriel facility using Machine Learning.

It can be used to train different machine learning models using existing experimental data.

The project is still in development and it is NOT ready for production. Notebooks used for data analysis, modeling and predictions are currently being saved here for convinience.
